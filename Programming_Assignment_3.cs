/*  
    Programmer:
    Date: 9/17/2018(Last Update: 9/21/2018
    Program: This program has 2 classes the first of which calls to the second and runs the display method after completeion. The second class either
    allows the user to input a students first, and last names, as well as their university, and assigns default grades of 3. Or the user can input first,
    and last names, university, easiness, and helfulness grades. It also prevents the names from being changed once input. University can be change but
    only by a property, and the grades can be change via accessor and mutator methods.
